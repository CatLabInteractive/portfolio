	<p><i>Thijs:</i> RtD is a webbased game I started developing in 2003. It started out with a little
		experimenting with PHP, but it turned out to become a game with over 15000 players.</p>

	<h3>Bazillionaire (2012 - concept)</h3>
	<p>Bazillionaire was a game concept / experiment with 3d webgl and websockets. The goal was to create a space trade simulator where thousands of players would drive a virtual economy. Using visual programming tools we would allow players to automate their factories and an auto-enforcable contract system would allow players to work for other players. The project was cancelled due to funding issues.</p>

	<ul class="facts">
		<li>Space trade simulator</li>
		<li>Budget: lots of time</li>
		<li>Funding: subsidy was requested but denied (<i>VAF aanvraag</i> included in files)</li>
		<li>Status: cancelled.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>After the cold (2015 - concept)</h3>
	<p>After the cold was meant to be mashup of Route to Destiny and Dolumar. The game would be set in a post apocalyptic wasteland where clans fight for whatever is left. Our goal was to take the Route to Destiny setting and turn it into a turn based strategy game.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Turn based strategy</li>
		<li>Budget: prototype estimated at €21.250</li>
		<li>Funding: subsidy was requested but denied (<i>VAF aanvraag</i> included in files)</li>
		<li>Status: frozen (get it?). A very early <a href="http://rtd5.herokuapp.com/">Gamejam Prototype</a> is online</li>
	</ul>
